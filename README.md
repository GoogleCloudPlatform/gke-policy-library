## Background

[Policy Controller](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/policy-controller), part of [Anthos Config Management](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/), is a Kubernetes [dynamic admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) that checks, audits, and enforces your clusters' compliance with policies related to security, regulations, or arbitrary business rules.

Policy Controller is based on the open source [Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) project. Gatekeeper policies are defined using two separate resource types: `Constraint`s and `ConstraintTemplate`s. Having two distinct resource types allows for separation of policy **definition** ([`ConstraintTemplate`](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/policy-controller#constraint_templates)) from policy **enforcement** ([`Constraint`](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/policy-controller#constraints)).

Policy Controller comes with a [library of ConstraintTemplates](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/reference/constraint-template-library) for common security and compliance controls.

This repository contains **sample** `Constraint`s which make use of Policy Controller's `ConstraintTemplates` to demonstrate how you might configure policy enforcement on your own cluster.
